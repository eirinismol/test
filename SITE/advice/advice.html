				<h3>Increase bright light exposure during the day</h3>
			</div>
				<div class="picture">

				<div class="text">
					<p>Your body has a natural time-keeping clock known as your circadian rhythm.
					It affects your brain, body, and hormones, helping you stay awake and telling your body when it’s time to sleep.	
					Natural sunlight or bright light during the day helps keep your circadian rhythm healthy. This improves daytime energy, as well as nighttime sleep quality and duration. In people with insomnia, daytime bright light exposure improved sleep quality and duration. It also reduced the time it took to fall asleep by 83%.While most research involves people with severe sleep issues, daily light exposure will most likely help you even if you experience average sleep.</p>

				<h3>Reduce blue light exposure in the evening</h3>
			</div>

			</div>
			<div class="text">
					<p>Exposure to light during the day is beneficial, but nighttime light exposure has the opposite effect.
					Again, this is due to its effect on your circadian rhythm, tricking your brain into thinking it’s still daytime. This reduces hormones like melatonin, which help you relax and get deep sleep.
					Blue light — which electronic devices like smartphones and computers emit in large amounts — is the worst in this regard.
					There are several popular methods you can use to reduce nighttime blue light exposure. These include:
					Wear glasses that block blue light.
					Install an app that blocks blue light on your smartphone. These are available for both iPhones and Android models.
					Stop watching TV and turn off any bright lights 2 hours before heading to bed.</p>

				<h3>Try to sleep and wake at consistent times</h3>
				</div>

				<div class="picture">
					<img src="..//advice/images/sleeping1.jpg" width="50%" height="200px">
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>Your body’s circadian rhythm functions on a set loop, aligning itself with sunrise and sunset.
					Being consistent with your sleep and waking times can aid long-term sleep quality.
					One study noted that participants who had irregular sleeping patterns and went to bed late on the weekends reported poor sleep.	Other studies have highlighted that irregular sleep patterns can alter your circadian rhythm and levels of melatonin, which signal your brain to sleep. If you struggle with sleep, try to get in the habit of waking up and going to bed at similar times. After several weeks, you may not even need an alarm.</p>

				<h3>Optimise your bedroom environment</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="picture">

			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>Many people believe that the bedroom environment and its setup are key factors in getting a good night’s sleep. These factors include temperature, noise, external lights, and furniture arrangement.
					Numerous studies point out that external noise, often from traffic, can cause poor sleep and long-term health issues.
					To optimize your bedroom environment, try to minimize external noise, light, and artificial lights from devices like alarm clocks. Make sure your bedroom is a quiet, relaxing, clean, and enjoyable place.</p>

				<h3>Set your bedroom temperature</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="picture">
				<img src="..//advice/images/girl1.jpg" width="50%" height="200px">
			</div>
			<div class="text">
					<p>Body and bedroom temperature can also profoundly affect sleep quality. As you may have experienced during the summer or in hot locations, it can be very hard to get a good night’s sleep when it’s too warm. One study found that bedroom temperature affected sleep quality more than external noise.			
					Other studies reveal that increased body and bedroom temperature can decrease sleep quality and increase wakefulness.
					Around 70°F (20°C) seems to be a comfortable temperature for most people, although it depends on your preferences and habits.</p>

				<h3>Don’t eat late in the evening</h3></div>
				<div class="picture">
					<img src="..//advice/images/baby2.jpg" width="50%" height="200px">
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>Eating late at night may negatively affect both sleep quality and the natural release of HGH and melatonin. That said, the quality and type of your late-night snack may play a role as well. In one study, a high carb meal eaten 4 hours before bed helped people fall asleep faster.	Interestingly, one study discovered that a low carb diet also improved sleep, indicating that carbs aren’t always necessary, especially if you’re used to a low carb diet.</p>
